\section{Results and Evaluation}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Evidence Artifacts and Experimental Workflow}
Evaluation was conducted at two levels: (i) \emph{toolchain-level validation} confirming that the custom authorization instruction is supported end-to-end (compile, assemble, link, and produce hex images), and (ii) \emph{system-level validation} confirming that both execution and debug access are gated by authorization.
Evidence was collected from the host-side application logs and screenshots extracted from the development artifacts.

\subsection{Toolchain Validation}
Fig.~\ref{fig:compile} shows compilation of a test program that invokes the custom instruction via inline assembly, along with successful ELF-to-HEX generation reported by the tool.
This demonstrates that the custom instruction can be emitted from C code and preserved across the build pipeline without manual binary patching.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Firmware Inspection (HEX Viewer)}
To support operator verification and troubleshooting, the host application provides a hex viewer for generated images.
Fig.~\ref{fig:hex} shows an example view of the generated hex contents.

  \label{fig:hex}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Authorization and Debug Enablement (Key Match)}
The core functional requirement is that debug access is released only after successful authorization.
Fig.~\ref{fig:auth} summarizes the authorization flow evidence: (top) key exchange and matching indication in the application log, and (bottom) the resulting debugger enablement after a successful match.

  \caption{Authorization and debug gating evidence: (top) key exchange and successful match indication; (bottom) debugger enabled after a successful match.}
  \label{fig:auth}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Connection and Programming Workflow}
Fig.~\ref{fig:program} summarizes the programming workflow evidence: (top) a successful connection state, and (bottom) a programming session log including the \texttt{load\_image} operation for a firmware ELF.

\begin{figure}[!t]

  \includegraphics[width=0.97\linewidth,height=0.19\textheight,keepaspectratio]{fig_connected.png}\vspace{0.3ex}
